<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
In both minor motorsport categories and racing e-sports there seems to be no easily accessible tool to collect, visualize and analyze live telemetry data. The user often has to perform complex installation tasks to run these tools on his own machine, which might not be powerful enough to handle real-time data stream analysis. 

This work proposes a possible baseline architecture to implement a data visualization and analysis tool for on-board telemetry data, completely based on cloud technologies and distributed systems. The proposed system falls under the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) paradigm and relies on Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud solutions to provide hardware support to its software components.

### Built With

This section lists any major frameworks/libraries used in this project.

Data source and front-end:
* [FastF1](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1)
* [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)

Back-end Apache services:
* [ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/)
* [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) - [KafkaPython](https://github.com/dpkp/kafka-python)
* [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html) - [PySpark](https://github.com/apache/spark)
